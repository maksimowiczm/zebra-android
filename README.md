## What is Zebra

Zebra is yet another Android KeePass password manager that you **SHOULD NOT**
use. Consider using a different and secure one instead. :)

## Experimental features

### Share

You can share your password with [zebra signal web
client](https://github.com/maksimowiczm/zebra-signal) using QR code. Data is
sent using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) data channel. It doesn't support turn servers.

#### Why is it experimental?

It's not secure, it's not private, it's not reliable. It lacks basic security
features like handshakes, encryption, etc. It's just a proof of concept.

## Questions and answers

#### Why it should not be used?

I only have a basic idea of cybersecurity. I do not guarantee that this app is not
a threat to your privacy and security.

#### Why does it exist then?

I wanted to create something useful (**FAILED**) for myself. Show myself
progress I've made since those abomination apps. ðŸ’€

- [ToDoApp-Android](https://github.com/maksimowiczm/ToDoApp-Android)


#### Why are there no tests?

It barely has any business logic. Testing if kotlin compiler works is not the
purpose of this app.
